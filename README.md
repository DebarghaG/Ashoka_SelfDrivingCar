# Ashokan_SelfDrivingCar

Over the next month , I will attempt to write the code to run a self-driving car around campus, completely autonomously.

## RaspberryPi_Stream
These libraries need to be run on individual Raspberry Pi communication protocol :
When the Stream_Client is run, it opens a network socket and sends the stream in the form of a set of jpeg images.

## Laptop
This is where all the streams come in, and the all the major image recognition algorithms occur.
