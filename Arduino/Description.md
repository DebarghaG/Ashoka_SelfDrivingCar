# Writeup about control and actuation for the car

## Arduino controlling a stepper motor for steering hack

Stepper motors are used everywhere in actuations because they help with accurate controlling. We will be implementing the same controlled by an arduino to translate rotational motion to drive the steering wheel.

This will help accurately control the degree at which the entire steering wheel is rotated.

It's important to know that this is not a long term solution but a way to create somewhat of a working hack that can be used with a basic car.
